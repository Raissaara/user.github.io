<p>The version most widely known today is based on the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothers_Grimm" title="Brothers Grimm">Brothers Grimm</a>&nbsp;variant. It is about a girl called Little Red Riding Hood, after the red&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hood_%28headgear%29" title="Hood   (headgear)">hooded</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape" title="Cape">cape</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloak" title="Cloak">cloak</a>&nbsp;she wears. The girl walks through the woods to deliver food to her sick grandmother.</p>

<p>A wolf wants to eat the girl but is afraid to do so in public. He approaches the girl, and she na&iuml;vely tells him where she is going. He suggests the girl pick some flowers, which she does. In the meantime, he goes to the grandmother&#39;s house and gains entry by pretending to be the girl. He swallows the grandmother whole, and waits for the girl, disguised as the grandmother.</p>
